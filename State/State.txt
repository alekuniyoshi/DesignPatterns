The State pattern is a design pattern used in software development to allow
an object to change its behavior based on its internal state.

In simpler terms, it's like a traffic light. A traffic light has different states (red, yellow, 
green) 
and changes its behavior (i.e. the color of the light it displays) based on its current state. 
Similarly, in the State pattern, an object has different states and changes its behavior based
on its current state.

This can be useful in situations where you have an object that needs to behave differently 
depending on its internal state. 
For example, suppose you have a vending machine that dispenses different types 
of products based on its current state (such as whether it has enough change,
or whether it has enough stock of a particular product). Using the State pattern,
you can define different states for the vending machine 
(such as "has change", "out of stock", etc.),
and the vending machine can change its behavior based on its current state.
The State pattern is often used in combination with other patterns, such as the Strategy pattern, 
to provide even more flexibility and modularity in the behavior of objects. 
By separating the behavior 
of an object into different states, you can make the code more maintainable 
and easier to extend over time.
