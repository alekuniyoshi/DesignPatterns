The Singleton pattern is a design pattern used in software development 
to ensure that a class can only have one
instance (object) created and used throughout the application.

In simpler terms, it's like having a house with only one key - no matter how 
many people need to access the house, they all have to share the same key 
to get in. Similarly, in the Singleton pattern, no matter how many
times you need to create an instance of a particular class in your program, 
there will only ever be one instance
created that can be shared by all parts of your program that need to use it.

This can be useful in situations where you want to make sure that a particular 
resource (such as a database
connection, logger object, or configuration settings) is only created once and 
used consistently throughout the
application, rather than creating multiple instances that could potentially
cause conflicts or waste resources.
