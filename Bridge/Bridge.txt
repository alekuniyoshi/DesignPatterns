The Bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software development to decouple an abstraction 
from its implementation, allowing 
them to vary independently.
In simpler terms, it's like separating what something does from how it does it. 
When you separate what something does from how it does it, 
you can change either one without affecting the other. Similarly, 
in the Bridge pattern, you separate an abstraction (such as a class or an interface) 
from its implementation (such as a concrete class or a library), allowing them to vary independently.

This can be useful in situations where you want to create a system that is 
flexible and maintainable over time. By separating the abstraction from its implementation, 
you can create different implementations of the same abstraction, allowing you to change 
the behavior of the system without affecting its overall structure.

For example, suppose you have a shape object that needs to be drawn on a screen. 
Using the Bridge pattern, you can define a shape abstraction and a drawing implementation, 
and then connect them using a bridge object. The shape abstraction defines the basic 
properties of the shape (such as its size and color), while the drawing implementation 
defines how the shape should be drawn on the screen (such as using a specific library or algorithm). 
The bridge object then connects the two, allowing you to change the drawing implementation 
without affecting the shape abstraction.
Overall, the Bridge pattern promotes loose coupling between different parts of a system, 
making it easier to maintain and extend over time.
