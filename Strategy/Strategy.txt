The Strategy pattern is a design pattern used in software 
development to allow for different algorithms or methods to be 
used interchangeably within an application.

In simpler terms, it's like having different tools in a toolbox that 
you can choose from depending on the task at hand. Similarly, in 
the Strategy pattern, you have a set of interchangeable 
algorithms or methods that can be used to perform a particular 
task. Each algorithm or method is encapsulated in its own class, 
making it easy to swap one implementation for another without 
affecting the rest of the code.

This can be useful in situations where you need to perform a task 
in different ways depending on certain conditions or inputs. 
For example, a sorting algorithm can be implemented using different 
strategies such as bubble sort, quick sort, or merge sort. Using 
the Strategy pattern, you can easily swap out one sorting 
algorithm for another without having to modify the rest of the code that uses the sorting 
algorithm. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain over time.
