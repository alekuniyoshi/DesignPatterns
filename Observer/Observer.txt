The Observer pattern is a design pattern used in software development to allow objects 
to be notified automatically when something changes in another object.
In simpler terms, it's like having a subscription to a magazine. When you subscribe 
to a magazine, you are automatically notified when a new issue is published. Similarly, 
in the Observer pattern, an object (known as the observer) subscribes 
to another object (known as the subject) and is notified automatically when the subject changes.

This can be useful in situations where you need to keep multiple objects in 
sync with each other. For example, if you have a list of data that is being 
displayed in multiple places in your application, you can use the Observer 
pattern to ensure that all instances of the list are 
updated automatically when the data changes.

The Observer pattern is also often used in event-driven systems, 
where multiple objects need to respond to a particular event (such as a button click). 
Using the Observer pattern, each object can register itself as an observer of the 
event and be notified automatically when the event occurs.
