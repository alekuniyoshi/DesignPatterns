The Builder pattern is a design pattern used in software development to separate 
the construction of an object from its representation.
In simpler terms, it's like building a house using a blueprint. 
When you build a house, you use a blueprint to guide the construction process. 
Similarly, in the Builder pattern, you use a builder object to guide the construction 
of a complex object, separating the process of 
constructing the object from the final representation of the object.
This can be useful in situations where you need to create complex objects 
that have many different parts or configurations. 
By using a builder object to guide the construction process, 
you can simplify the creation of the object and make it more flexible and maintainable.
For example, suppose you need to create a car object with different 
options and configurations (such as the type of engine, the color, the wheels, etc.). 
Using the Builder pattern, you can define a car builder object that takes care of the construction process, 
allowing you to specify the options and configurations you need. The car builder object can then build the car 
object according to the specified options and configurations, separating the process of constructing the car 
from the final representation of the car object.
